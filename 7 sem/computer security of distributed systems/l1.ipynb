    "main_text = r\"\"\"techno is a genre of electronic dance music which is generally produced for use in a continuous dj set with tempo often varying between and beats per minute bpm the central rhythm is typically in common time and often characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines sequencers and synthesizers as well as digital audio workstations drum machines from the s such as rolands tr and tr are highly prized and software emulations of such retro instruments are popular much of the instrumentation in techno emphasizes the role of rhythm over other musical parameters techno tracks mainly progress over manipulation of timbral characteristics of synthesizer presets and unlike forms of edm that tend to be produced with synthesizer keyboards techno does not always strictly adhere to the harmonic practice of western music and such structures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone another distinguishing feature of techno music and techno aesthetic is the general embracement of creative use of music production technology use of the term techno to refer to a type of electronic music originated in germany in the early s in following the uk release of the compilation techno the new dance sound of detroit the term came to be associated with a form of edm produced in detroit detroit techno resulted from the melding of synthpop by artists such as kraftwerk giorgio moroder and yellow magic orchestra with african american styles such as house electro and funk added to this is the influence of futuristic and sciencefiction themes relevant to life in american late capitalist society with alvin tofflers book the third wave a notable point of reference the music produced in the midtolate s by juan atkins derrick may and kevin saunderson collectively known as the belleville three along with eddie fowlkes blake baxter james pennington and others is viewed as the first wave of techno from detroit after the success of house music in a number of european countries techno grew in popularity in the uk germany belgium and the netherlands in europe regional variants quickly evolved and by the early s techno subgenres such as acid hardcore bleep ambient and dub techno had developed music journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles such as tech house and trance detroit techno main article detroit techno see also electro music house music italo disco kraftwerk and synthpop in exploring detroit technos origins writer kodwo eshun maintains that kraftwerk are to techno what muddy waters is to the rolling stones the authentic the origin the real juan atkins has acknowledged that he had an early enthusiasm for kraftwerk and giorgio moroder particularly moroders work with donna summer and the producers own album emc atkins also mentions that around i had a tape of nothing but kraftwerk telex devo giorgio moroder and gary numan and id ride around in my car playing it regarding his initial impression of kraftwerk atkins notes that they were clean and precise relative to the weird ufo sounds featured in his seemingly psychedelic music derrick may identified the influence of kraftwerk and other european synthesizer music in commenting that it was just classy and clean and to us it was beautiful like outer space living around detroit there was so little beauty everything is an ugly mess in detroit and so we were attracted to this music it like ignited our imagination may has commented that he considered his music a direct continuation of the european synthesizer tradition he also identified japanese synthpop act yellow magic orchestra particularly member ryuichi sakamoto and british band ultravox as influences along with kraftwerk ymos song technopolis a tribute to tokyo as an electronic mecca is considered an interesting contribution to the development of detroit techno foreshadowing concepts that atkins and davis would later explore with cybotron kevin saunderson has also acknowledged the influence of europe but he claims to have been more inspired by the idea of making music with electronic equipment i was more infatuated with the idea that i can do this all myself these early detroit techno artists additionally employed science fiction imagery to articulate their visions of a transformed society school days prior to achieving notoriety atkins saunderson may and fowlkes shared common interests as budding musicians mix tape traders and aspiring djs they also found musical inspiration via the midnight funk association an eclectic fivehour latenight radio program hosted on various detroit radio stations including wchb wgpr and wjlbfm from through the mids by dj charles the electrifying mojo johnson mojos show featured electronic music by artists such as giorgio moroder kraftwerk yellow magic orchestra and tangerine dream alongside the funk sounds of acts such as parliament funkadelic and dance oriented new wave music by bands like devo and the bs atkins has noted he mojo played all the parliament and funkadelic that anybody ever wanted to hear those two groups were really big in detroit at the time in fact they were one of the main reasons why disco didnt really grab hold in detroit in mojo used to play a lot of funk just to be different from all the other stations that had gone over to disco when knee deep came out that just put the last nail in the coffin of disco music despite the shortlived disco boom in detroit it had the effect of inspiring many individuals to take up mixing juan atkins among them subsequently atkins taught may how to mix records and in magic juan derrick mayday in conjunction with three other djs one of whom was eddie flashin fowlkes launched themselves as a party crew called deep space soundworks also referred to as deep space in or they met with mojo and proposed that they provide mixes for his show which they did end up doing the following year during the late searly s high school clubs such as brats charivari ciabattino comrades gables hardwear rafael rumours snobs and weekends allowed the young promoters to develop and nurture a local dance music scene as the local scene grew in popularity djs began to band together to market their mixing skills and sound systems to clubs that were hoping to attract larger audiences local church activity centers vacant warehouses offices and ymca auditoriums were the early locations where the musical form was nurtured juan atkins main articles juan atkins and cybotron american band of the four individuals responsible for establishing techno as a genre in its own right juan atkins is widely cited as the originator in the american music technology publication keyboard magazine honored him as one of who count in the history of keyboard music\n",
    "in the early s atkins began recording with musical partner richard davis and later with a third member jon as cybotron this trio released a number of rock and electroinspired tunes the most successful of which were clear and its moodier followup techno city \n",
    "atkins used the term techno to describe cybotrons music taking inspiration from futurist author alvin toffler the original source for words such as cybotron and metroplex atkins has described earlier synthesizer based acts like kraftwerk as techno although many would consider both kraftwerks and juans cybotron outputs as electro atkins viewed cybotrons cosmic cars as unique germanic synthesized funk but he later heard afrika bambaataas planet rock and considered it to be a superior example of the music he envisioned inspired he resolved to continue experimenting and he encouraged saunderson and may to do likewise\n",
    "eventually atkins started producing his own music under the pseudonym model and in he established the record label metroplex the same year saw an important turning point for the detroit scene with the release of model s no ufos a seminal work that is generally considered the first techno production of this time atkins has said\n",
    "when i started metroplex around february or march of and released no ufos i thought i was just going to make my money back on it but i wound up selling between and copies i had no idea that my record would happen in chicago derricks parents had moved there and he was making regular trips between detroit and chicago so when i came out with no ufos he took copies out to chicago and gave them to some djs and it just happened\n",
    "chicago see also chicago house and house music\n",
    "the musics producers especially may and saunderson admit to having been fascinated by the chicago club scene and influenced by house in particular mays hit strings of life released under the alias rhythim is rhythim is considered a classic in both the house and techno genres\n",
    "juan atkins also believes that the first acid house producers seeking to distance house music from disco emulated the techno sound atkins also suggests that the chicago house sound developed as a result of frankie knuckles using a drum machine he bought from derrick may he claims\n",
    "derrick sold chicago dj frankie knuckles a tr drum machine this was back when the powerplant was open in chicago but before any of the chicago djs were making records they were all into playing italian imports no ufos was the only usbased independent record that they played so frankie knuckles started using the at his shows at the powerplant boss had just brought out their little sampling footpedal and somebody took one along there somebody was on the mic and they sampled that and played it over the drumtrack pattern having got the drum machine and the sampler they could make their own tunes to play at parties one thing just led to another and chip e used the to make his own record and from then on all these djs in chicago borrowed that to come out with their own records\n",
    "in the uk a club following for house music grew steadily from with interest sustained by scenes in london manchester nottingham and later sheffield and leeds the djs thought to be responsible for houses early uk success include mike pickering mark moore colin faver and graeme park\n",
    "detroit sound\n",
    "the early producers enabled by the increasing affordability of sequencers and synthesizers merged a european synthpop aesthetic with aspects of soul funk disco and electro pushing edm into uncharted terrain they deliberately rejected the motown legacy and traditional formulas of rb and soul and instead embraced technological experimentation\n",
    "within the last years or so the detroit underground has been experimenting with technology stretching it rather than simply using it as the price of sequencers and synthesizers has dropped so the experimentation has become more intense basically were tired of hearing about being in love or falling out tired of the rb system so a new progressive sound has emerged we call it techno\n",
    "juan atkins \n",
    "the resulting detroit sound was interpreted by derrick may and one journalist in as a postsoul sound with no debt to motown but by another journalist a decade later as soulful grooves melding the beatcentric styles of motown with the music technology of the time may described the sound of techno as something that is like detroita complete mistake its like george clinton and kraftwerk are stuck in an elevator with only a sequencer to keep them company juan atkins has stated that it is music that sounds like technology and not technology that sounds like music meaning that most of the music you listen to is made with technology whether you know it or not but with techno music you know it\n",
    "one of the first detroit productions to receive wider attention was derrick mays strings of life which together with mays previous release nude photo helped raise technos profile in europe especially the uk and germany during the house music boom see second summer of love it became mays best known track which according to frankie knuckles just exploded it was like something you cant imagine the kind of power and energy people got off that record when it was first heard mike dunn says he has no idea how people can accept a record that doesnt have a bassline\n",

    "the success of house and acid house paved the way for wider acceptance of the detroit sound and vice versa techno was initially supported by a handful of house music clubs in chicago new york and northern england with london clubs catching up later but in it was strings of life which eased london clubgoers into acceptance of house according to dj mark moore\n",

    "derrick may views this as one of his busiest times and recalls that it was a period where he\n",
    "was working with carl craig helping kevin helping juan trying to put neil rushton in the right position to meet everybody trying to get blake baxter endorsed so that everyone liked him trying to convince shake anthony shakir that he should be more assertiveand keep making music as well as do the mayday mix for the show street beat on detroits wjlb radio station and run transmat records\n",
    "commercially the release did not fare as well and failed to recoup but inner citys production big fun a track that was almost not included on the compilation became a crossover hit in fall the record was also responsible for bringing industry attention to may atkins and saunderson which led to discussions with ztt records about forming a techno supergroup called intellex but when the group were on the verge of finalising their contract may allegedly refused to agree to top of the pops appearances and negotiations collapsed according to may ztt label boss trevor horn had envisaged that the trio would be marketed as a black petshop boys\n",
    "despite virgin records disappointment with the poor sales of rushtons compilation the record was successful in establishing an identity for techno and was instrumental in creating a platform in europe for both the music and its producers ultimately the release served to distinguish the detroit sound from chicago house and other forms of underground dance music that were emerging during the rave era of the late s and early s a period during which techno became more adventurous and distinct\n",
    "music institute\n",
    "in mid developments in the detroit scene led to the opening of a nightclub called the music institute mi located at broadway in downtown detroit the venue was secured by george baker and alton miller with darryl wynn and derrick may participating as friday night djs and baker and chez damier playing to a mostly gay crowd on saturday nights\n",
    "the club closed on november with derrick may playing strings of life along with a recording of clock tower bells may explains\n",
    "it all happened at the right time by mistake and it didnt last because it wasnt supposed to last our careers took off right around the time we the mi had to close and maybe it was the best thing i think we were peaking we were so full of energy and we didnt know who we were or how to realize our potential we had no inhibitions no standards we just did it thats why it came off so fresh and innovative and thats whywe got the best of the best\n",
    "though shortlived mi was known internationally for its allnight sets its sparse white rooms and its juice bar stocked with smart drinks the institute never served liquor the mi notes dan sicko along with detroits early techno pioneers helped give life to one of the citys important musical subcultures one that was slowly growing into an international scene\n",

    "the frankfurt tape scene evolved around the early and experimental work done by the likes of tobias freund uwe schmidt lars müller and martin schopf some of the work done by andreas tomalla markus nikolai and thomas franzmann evolved in collaborative work under the bigod collective while this early work was strongly characterized as experimental electronic music fused with strong ebm krautrock synthpop and technopop influences the later work during the mid and late s clearly transitioned to a clear techno sound\n",

    "in a number of party venues in berlin closed including ufo and the citys techno scene centered itself around three locations close to the foundations of the berlin wall planet ewerk bunker and the longlived tresor it was in tresor at this time that a trend in paramilitary clothing was established amongst the techno fraternity by dj tanith possibly as an expression of a commitment to the underground aesthetic of the music or perhaps influenced by urs paramilitary posturing in the same period german djs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound as an acid infused techno began transmuting into hardcore dj tanith commented at the time that berlin was always hardcore hardcore hippie hardcore punk and now we have a very hardcore house sound this emerging sound is thought to have been influenced by dutch gabber and belgian hardcore styles that were in their own perverse way paying homage to underground resistance and richie hawtins plus records other influences on the development of this style were european electronic body music ebm groups of the mids such as daf front and nitzer ebb\n",
    "changes were also taking place in frankfurt during the same period but it did not share the egalitarian approach found in the berlin party scene it was instead very much centered around discothèques and existing arrangements with various club owners in after the omen opened the frankfurt dance music scene was allegedly dominated by the clubs management and they made it difficult for other promoters to get a start by the early s sven väth had become perhaps the first dj in germany to be worshipped like a rock star he performed center stage with his fans facing him and as coowner of omen he is believed to have been the first techno dj to run his own club one of the few real alternatives then was the bruckenkopf in mainz underneath a rhine bridge a venue that offered a noncommercial alternative to frankfurts discothèquebased clubs other notable underground parties were those run by force inc music works and ata heiko from playhouse records ongaku musik by dj dag torsten fenslau were running a sunday morning session at dorian gray a plush discothèque near the frankfurt airport they initially played a mix of different styles including belgian new beat deep house chicago house and synthpop such as kraftwerk and yello and it was out of this blend of styles that the frankfurt trance scene is believed to have emerged\n",

    "tekkno versus techno\n",
    "in germany fans started to refer to the harder techno sound emerging in the early s as tekkno or brett this alternative spelling with varying numbers of ks began as a tongueincheek attempt to emphasize the musics hardness but by the mids it came to be associated with a controversial point of view that the music was and perhaps always had been wholly separate from detroits techno deriving instead from a s ebmoriented club scene cultivated in part by djmusician talla xlc in frankfurt\n",
    "at some point tension over who defines techno arose between scenes in frankfurt and berlin dj tanith has expressed that techno as a term already existed in germany but was to a large extent undefined dimitri hegemann has stated that the frankfurt definition of techno associated with tallas technoclub differed from that used in berlin frankfurts armin johnert viewed techno as having its roots in acts such daf cabaret voltaire and suicide but a younger generation of club goers had a perception of the older ebm and industrial as handed down and outdated the berlin scene offered an alternative and many began embracing an imported sound that was being referred to as technohouse the move away from ebm had started in berlin when acid house became popular thanks to monika dietls radio show on sfb tanith distinguished acidbased dance music from the earlier approaches whether it be daf or nitzer ebb because the latter was aggressive he felt that it epitomized being against something but of acid house he said its electronic its fun its nice by spring tanith along with wolle xdp an eastberlin party organizer responsible for the xtasy dance project were organizing the first large scale rave events in germany this development would lead to a permanent move away from the sound associated with technohouse and toward a hard edged mix of music that came to define tanith and wolles tekknozid parties according to wolle it was an out and out rejection of disco values instead they created a sound storm and encouraged a form of dance floor socialism where the dj was not placed in the middle and you lose yourself in light and sound\n",

    "the term intelligent techno was used to differentiate more sophisticated versions of underground techno from raveoriented styles such as breakbeat hardcore schranz dutch gabber warp records was among the first to capitalize upon this development with the release of the compilation album artificial intelligence of this time warp founder and managing director steve beckett said\n",
    "the dance scene was changing and we were hearing bsides that werent dance but were interesting and fitted into experimental progressive rock so we decided to make the compilation artificial intelligence which became a milestone it felt like we were leading the market rather than it leading us the music was aimed at home listening rather than clubs and dance floors people coming home off their nuts and having the most interesting part of the night listening to totally tripped out music the sound fed the scene\n",
    "warp had originally marketed artificial intelligence using the description electronic listening music but this was quickly replaced by intelligent techno in the same period other names were also bandied about such as armchair techno ambient techno and electronica but all referred to an emerging form of postrave dance music for the sedentary and stay at home following the commercial success of the compilation in the united states intelligent dance music eventually became the name most commonly used for much of the experimental dance music emerging during the midtolate s\n",
    "although it is primarily warp that has been credited with ushering the commercial growth of idm and electronica in the early s there were many notable labels associated with the initial intelligence trend that received little if any wider attention amongst others they include black dog productions carl craigs planet e kirk degiorgios applied rhythmic technology eevo lute muzique general production recordings in a number of new intelligent technoelectronica record labels emerged including new electronica mille plateaux pure and ferox records \n",

    "with an increasing diversification and commercialization of dance music the collectivist sentiment prominent in the early rave scene diminished each new faction having its own particular attitude and vision of how dance music or in certain cases nondance music should evolve according to muzik magazine by the uk techno scene was in decline and dedicated club nights were dwindling the music had become too hard too fast too male too drugoriented too anally retentive despite this weekly night at clubs such as final frontier londonthe orbit leeds house of god birmingham pure edinburgh whose resident dj twitch later founded the more eclectic optimo and bugged out manchester were still popular with techno reaching a state of creative palsy and with a disproportionate number of underground dance music enthusiasts more interested in the sounds of rave and jungle in the future of the uk techno scene looked uncertain as the market for pure techno waned muzik described the sound of uk techno at this time as dutiful grovelling at the altar of american techno with a total unwillingness to compromise\n",

    "prototechno\n",
    "the popularity of euro disco and italo discoreferred to as progressive in detroitand new romantic synthpop in the detroit high school party scene from which techno emerged has prompted a number of commentators to try to redefine the origins of techno by incorporating musical precursors to the detroit sound as part of a wider historical survey of the genres development the search for a mythical first techno record leads such commentators to consider music from long before the naming of the genre aside from the artists whose music was popular in the detroit high school scene progressive disco acts such as giorgio moroder alexander robotnick and claudio simonetti and synthpop artists such as visage new order depeche mode the human league and heaven they point to examples such as sharevari by a number of names danceable selections from kraftwerk the earliest compositions by cybotron moroders from here to eternity and manuel göttschings prototechno masterpiece ee the song i feel love produced by giorgio moroder for donna summer in has been described as a milestone and blueprint for edm because it was the first to combine repetitive synthesizer loops with a continuous fouronthefloor bass drum and an offbeat hihat which would become a main feature of techno and house ten years later another example is a record entitled love in c minor released in by parisian euro disco producer jeanmarc cerrone cited as the first so called conceptual disco production and the record from which house techno and other underground dance music styles flowed yet another example is yellow magic orchestras work which has been described as prototechno\n",
    "around sheffield band cabaret voltaire began including funk and edm elements into their sound and in later years would come to be described as techno nitzer ebb was an essex band formed in which also showed funk and edm influence on their sound around this time the danish band laid back released white horse in with a similar funky electronica sound\n",
    "prehistory\n",
    "certain electrodisco and european synthpop productions share with techno a dependence on machinegenerated dance rhythms but such comparisons are not without contention efforts to regress further into the past in search of earlier antecedents entails a further regression to the sequenced electronic music of raymond scott whose the rhythm modulator the bassline generator and ibm probe are considered early examples of technolike music in a review of scotts manhattan research inc compilation album the english newspaper the independent suggested that scotts importance lies mainly in his realization of the rhythmic possibilities of electronic music which laid the foundation for all electropop from disco to techno in a tape from the midtolate s by the original composer of the doctor who theme delia derbyshire was found to contain music that sounded remarkably like contemporary edm commenting on the tape paul hartnoll of the dance group orbital described the example as quite amazing noting that it sounded not unlike something that could be coming out next week on warp records\n",
    "music production practice\n",
    "stylistic considerations\n",
    "in general techno is very djfriendly being mainly instrumental commercial varieties being an exception and is produced with the intention of its being heard in the context of a continuous dj set wherein the dj progresses from one record to the next via a synchronized segue or mix much of the instrumentation in techno emphasizes the role of rhythm over other musical parameters but the design of synthetic timbres and the creative use of music production technology in general are important aspects of the overall aesthetic practice\n",
    "unlike other forms of edm that tend to be produced with synthesizer keyboards techno does not always strictly adhere to the harmonic practice of western music and such strictures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone the use of motivic development though relatively limited and the employment of conventional musical frameworks is more widely found in commercial techno styles for example eurotrance where the template is often an aaba song structure\n",
    "the main drum part is almost universally in common time meaning quarter note pulses per bar in its simplest form time is marked with kicks bass drum beats on each quarternote pulse a snare or clap on the second and fourth pulse of the bar with an open hihat sound every second eighth note this is essentially a drum pattern popularized by disco or even polka and is common throughout house and trance music as well the tempo tends to vary between approximately bpm quarter note equals pulses per minute and bpm depending on the style of techno\n",
    "some of the drum programming employed in the original detroitbased techno made use of syncopation and polyrhythm yet in many cases the basic discotype pattern was used as a foundation with polyrhythmic elaborations added using other drum machine voices this syncopatedfeel funkiness distinguishes the detroit strain of techno from other variants it is a feature that many djs and producers still use to differentiate their music from commercial forms of techno the majority of which tend to be devoid of syncopation derrick may has summed up the sound as hitech tribalism something very spiritual very bass oriented and very drum oriented very percussive the original techno music was very hitech with a very percussive feel it was extremely extremely tribal it feels like youre in some sort of hitech village\n",
    "compositional techniques\n",
    "there are many ways to create techno but the majority will depend upon the use of loopbased step sequencing as a compositional method techno musicians or producers rather than employing traditional compositional techniques may work in an improvisatory fashion often treating the electronic music studio as one large instrument the collection of devices found in a typical studio will include units that are capable of producing many different sounds and effects studio production equipment is generally synchronized using a hardware or computerbased midi sequencer enabling the producer to combine in one arrangement the sequenced output of many devices a typical approach to using this type of technology compositionally is to overdub successive layers of material while continuously looping a single measure or sequence of measures this process will usually continue until a suitable multitrack arrangement has been produced\n",
    "once a single loopbased arrangement has been generated a producer may then focus on developing how the summing of the overdubbed parts will unfold in time and what the final structure of the piece will be some producers achieve this by adding or removing layers of material at appropriate points in the mix quite often this is achieved by physically manipulating a mixer sequencer effects dynamic processing equalization and filtering while recording to a multitrack device other producers achieve similar results by using the automation features of computerbased digital audio workstations techno can consist of little more than cleverly programmed rhythmic sequences and looped motifs combined with signal processing of one variety or another frequency filtering being a commonly used process a more idiosyncratic approach to production is evident in the music of artists such as twerk and autechre where aspects of algorithmic composition are employed in the generation of material\n",
    "retro technology\n",
    "instruments used by the original techno producers based in detroit many of which are highly sought after on the retro music technology market include classic drum machines like the roland tr and tr devices such as the roland tb bass line generator and synthesizers such as the roland sh kawai kc yamaha dx and yamaha dx as heard on derrick mays seminal techno release nude photo much of the early music sequencing was executed via midi but neither the tr nor the tb had midi only din sync using hardware sequencers such as the korg sqd and roland mc and the limited amount of sampling that was featured in this early style was accomplished using an akai s\n",
    "by the mids tr and tr drum machines had already achieved legendary status a fact reflected in the prices sought for used devices during the s the became the staple beat machine in hip hop production while the found its home in house music and techno it was the pioneers of detroit techno who were making the the rhythmic basis of their sound and setting the stage for the rise of rolands vintage rhythm composer in november the uk music technology magazine sound on sound noted\n",
    "there can be few hitech instruments which still command a secondhand price only slightly lower than their original selling price years after their launch rolands now nearlegendary tr is such an examplereleased in with a retail price of £ they now fetch up to £ on the secondhand market the irony of the situation is that barely a year after its launch the was being chopped out by hitech dealers for around £ to make way for the thennew tr and tr prices hit a new low around when you could often pick up a seconduser for under £and occasionally even under £ musicians all over the country are now garrotting themselves with midi leads as they remember that they sneered at for £or worse the one they sold for £ did you ever hear the one about the guy who gave away his tb basslinenow worth anything up to £ from true loony collectorsbecause he couldnt sell it\n",
    "by may sound on sound was reporting that the popularity of the had started to decline with the rarer tr taking its place as the dance floor drum machine to use this is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons the gives more control over the drum sounds has better programming and includes midi as standard sound on sound reported that the was selling for between £ and £ and noted that the was still collectible but maximum prices had peaked at about £ to £ despite this fascination with retro music technology according to derrick may there is no recipe there is no keyboard or drum machine which makes the best techno or whatever you want to call it there never has been it was down to the preferences of a few guys the was our preference we were using yamaha drum machines different percussion machines whatever\n",
    "emulation\n",
    "in the latter half of the s the demand for vintage drum machines and synthesizers motivated a number of software companies to produce computerbased emulators one of the most notable was the rebirth rb produced by the swedish company propellerhead and originally released in may version one of the software featured two tbs and a tr only but the release of version two saw the inclusion of a tr a sound on sound review of the rb v in november noted that rebirth had been called the ultimate techno software package and mentions that it was a considerable software success story of in america keyboard magazine asserted that rebirth had opened up a whole new paradigm modeled analog synthesizer tones percussion synthesis patternbased sequencing all integrated in one piece of software despite the success of rebirth rb it was officially taken out of production in september propellerhead then made it freely available for download from a website called the rebirth museum the site also features extensive information about the softwares history and development\n",
    "in propellerhead released reason v a softwarebased electronic music studio comprising a input automated digital mixer note polyphonic analogue synth classic rolandstyle drum machine sampleplayback unit analoguestyle step sequencer loop player multitrack sequencer eight effects processors and over mb of synthesizer patches and samples with this release propellerhead were credited with creating a buzz that only happens when a product has really tapped into the zeitgeist and may just be the one that many were waiting for reason is as of at version \n",
    "technological advances\n",
    "during the mid to late s as computer technology became more accessible and music software advanced interacting with music production technology was possible using means that bore little relationship to traditional musical performance practices for instance laptop performance laptronica and live coding by the mids a number of softwarebased virtual studio environments had emerged with products such as propellerheads reason and ableton live finding popular appeal also during this period software versions of classic devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain became available for the first time these softwarebased music production tools offered viable and costeffective alternatives to typical hardwarebased production studios and thanks to continued advances in microprocessor technology it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer using highly configurable software tools artists could also easily tailor their production sound by creating personalized software synthesizers effects modules and various composition environments some of the more popular programs for achieving such ends included commercial releases such as maxmsp and reaktor and freeware packages such as pure data supercollider and chuck in a certain sense this technological innovation lead to the resurgence of the diy mentality that was once central to dance music culture in the s these advances democratized music creation and lead to a significant increase in the amount of homeproduced music available to the general public via the internet\n",
    "notable techno venues\n",
    "in germany noted techno clubs of the s include tresor and ewerk in berlin omen and dorian gray in frankfurt ultraschall and in munich as well as stammheim in kassel in berghain was cited as possibly the current world capital of techno much as ewerk or tresor were in their respective heydays in the s aside from berlin germany continued to have a thriving techno scene with clubs such as gewölbe in cologne institut für zukunft in leipzig mma club and blitz club in munich die rakete in nuremberg and robert johnson in offenbach am main\n",
    "in the united kingdom glasgows sub club has been associated with techno since the early s and clubs such as londons fabric and egg london have gained notoriety for supporting techno in the s a techno scene also emerged in georgia with the bassiani in tbilisi being the most notable venue\"\"\";"
